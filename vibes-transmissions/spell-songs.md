## Room

Everyone
arrives
in space
waiting
empty.

## Cairn

Which way?
the world answers in
rhythm: left, right, up —
I am so I go *here*.

It's too simple so
we made a special version:
which way should I choose?

Three words for
a loop, like this:
What are the options?
Which is safest?
Which is best?
Which feels right?
Who will I be today and
what will they say and
who was I yesterday and
Who am I now?

Which way should I choose?

Which way?

## Ritual burning of major arcana no. 15

Let's go for a drive
with Dolours - how's Tuesday?
Yeah the car runs fine
it's American and you
get used to the smell -
sweet almonds and earth.
But try to be open,
she's got lots to show
& no one gets indicted for
saying mmm-hm. I don't love
the violence either but it's
nice to be curious - even
you can pretend before
deciding you know the story.

I dunno what you're imagining
but we're not leaving
a trail of limbs behind us -
not this time. But if
you're scared try to picture
this: the curtain drops and
we're slipping out the
side door as you look to me,
eyes cobalt-thick with fear
searching for the same
reassurance I'll give you
now: nothing's gonna blow up &
you're already holding the bomb.
You took it from me
remember?
Now start the timer.
